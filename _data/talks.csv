sauramaia,how to human in groups,"if you’ve ever tried to convince your high school friends that being racist is kinda terrible, or your work friends that they should use a password manager, this talk is for you. 

changing people’s minds is hard. each group has its own version of what’s normal. this talk is about how to work with the brain tools we’ve got to make the computer tools we want.",sauramaia,"sauramaia likes dinosaurs. they constantly invent things while knitting, like maths and physics lectures titled &#x27;learning with sticks and strings&#x27;, which never materialise, and fill their days moving post-it notes around at thoughtworks.",
sera,IAM confused: a deep dive into how permissions work,"One of the hardest things to understand in the world of cloud computing has to be IAM - What is a role? What is a policy? How do I keep my engineers away from production systems? How do? The aim of this talk is to try and give some practical examples to help security teams understand whats going on, and how to use this to keep their infrastructure running smoothly and safely.",sera,9 Hunter at Pushpay. Please share your best cat pictures with me.,"This is primarily a focus on AWS and the structure of their role/permission flow. However, it is fairly introductory, so not a lot of prior knowledge should be needed (except maybe that there is tech hosted in the cloud)"
shahn-harris,Embracing Empathy,"Empathy is a personality trait which is not often discussed in the world of InfoSec. In an industry with highly authoritative technical personalities, curious technical explorers and fully transparent decision makers empathy is the odd one out, why care about what other people think or feel when you have the mandate to enforce policy/solutions/architecture/technology as you have funding and &quot;because security&quot;.

In this talk I will take you through how in my now near 20-year career predominately in the enterprise space I have tried to be anything BUT empathetic, the feeling of impostor syndrome I carried around for years as the way I worked and achieved results was not covered by any conference talks/certs/training/industry groups. And how through necessity I went from realizing that while my approach to InfoSec had always been classed as &quot;pragmatic&quot; it was empathetic. And that Empathy worked wonders in the most trying time of my career.",Shahn Harris,Shahn is a corporate infosec jerk who has been the cause and solution to a number of security related incidents since the the early 2000&#x27;s.,"none, this is a good old war story/lessons learned talk from someone who has been through the ringer."
william,*banging fists on table* STATE MACHINES STATE MACHINES,"Writing software is hard. Really hard. Almost impossible one would say. We can see this from &lt;infinite list of security issues here&gt;. As we all are walking talking fleshy bug emitting machines that sometimes emit good code as a lucky side effect, we need all the help we can get to increase this luck factor. 

State machines help us to reason about our programs, how they work, how they wont work, and why they didn&#x27;t work - and from there, how we can design programs to never fail at all. There are state machines all around us. Let me show you how we can use them in code for security and robustness.

Area and assumed knowledge:
Area - Secure software development. 
Assumptions - Some programming knowledge, but demos will be in Rust and C. I will not use advanced or tricky code for any demo to make it as accessible as possible.",William,"William is a senior IDM tech debt collector for SUSE.

anton-black,"Against Lies, H*cking Lies","Did you know that the more Blue Teamers are sent to handle a security incident, the worse that incident will be?

Using science and statistics to make decisions about how you run security is a great idea - /if/ you can interpret and represent your data accurately. But statistics is rife with potential pitfalls that can lead you to all kinds of false conclusions.

Learn how to recognize and work around these problems to not only use your own data for good, but to also catch flawed analyses when you see them around you.",Anton Black,"Anton aspires to speak clearly, concisely, humorously and precisely about something or other. He dabbles in Product Security at Atlassian, and enjoys playing the other kind of keyboard.","Topic: Analysis/retrospectives

moss,choose your own adventure: password reset,"You build or are part of a team that has a thing on the web that does stuff for people. And those people would appreciate it if other people couldn&#x27;t pretend to be them on your website doing their secret squirrel stuff.

So, you decide to have people login in with a password. It&#x27;d be mighty nice of you to give people a way to recover their accounts when they misplace their passwords.

Password reset flows are a choose your own adventure where the players just  want to be able to secret squirrel again, and if you&#x27;re in charge of one let&#x27;s learn about some game overs everyone would like to avoid.",moss,"moss enjoys working in highly regulated software industries, like healthcare and finance, caring for the quality of software. apple photos has decided that the best photos he takes are of software bugs in public places, and moss is slowly making peace with that.","This talk is aimed at people who are on the developing or defending side of websites with user management and password reset flows, whether you&#x27;ve rolled your own or integrated an authentication provider. It would be good to know the difference between a HTTP GET request and a POST request"

ben-dechrai,To Identity and Beyond!,"It&#x27;s unusual to develop applications that have no identity requirements nowadays. Whether it&#x27;s securing access to resources, synchronising data between devices, or providing a customised experience, any new project will soon need that login form.

While you might start out with a simple login form and a backend user directory, these soon grow into their own beasts, when requirements call for multi-factor authentication, or machine-to-machine authorisation functionality.

These requirements and associated maintenance costs are often at odds with the desire to focus on building new features that actually bring your users value, or fixing bugs that currently bring them pain.

In this talk, you will learn about OAuth, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Tokens; where they came from, how they work, and how they can simplify your projects, from single-page apps to the APIs that drive them, and everything in between.",Ben Dechrai,"Ben Dechrai is a technologist with a staunch focus on security and privacy. This started at the age of 11, when he wrote software to stop his parents from breaking the family PC, and resulted in his working as a developer advocate for Auth0.

mikala-easte,Risk management without slowing down,"Most organisations start out relying on people and their expertise when making decisions, but this doesn&#x27;t scale well and leads to bottlenecks and pain. Larger corporates rely on processes, controls and systems, but these can overwhelm smaller companies. I&#x27;d like to share some thoughts on how to set up lightweight risk management processes to empower teams to make informed decisions and not just rely on what the security person thinks of it.",Mikala Easte,"I had brief ambitions of being a penetration tester, and then someone ranted at me about symptoms and root causes and now I am a risk management consultant. I mostly help organisations manage their cyber risk when it comes to software development, third parties and business continuity.",Risk management with a bit of a building things securely lens
kirk,Incident Response Drills: How to play games and get good,"Computers are exceptionally good at taking instructions and making very fast, very precise mistakes very reliably. Humans are conceptually similar but interpret their inputs and decide on courses of action based on experience. 

Preperation and rehearsal for messy, no-notice events that are definitely (hopefuly) not business  as usual makes us more chill for when something (production) does go down due to novel (gremlins) issues. Incident Responders should practice for sensitive and time-critical events before they happen so they are able to return things to a safe and stable state with grace and aplomb.

This talk is for team leaders or security program owners interested in the craft of using incident response exercises to develop their people. We will learn how these synthetic experiences can be devised against specific environments and standards with measurable outcomes. Finally we will cover ways to easily scale difficulty and iteratively improve your exercise program.",Kirk,"Kirk is a Security Consultant at TSS Cyber in Canberra, joining the team after 10 years in Air Force ICT working on training exercises, drills and training programs for the military and non-profits. He has been a Dungeon Master for most of his life and found those skills are surprisingly trasnferable to his work and now thinks a lot about using games to improve teams and evaluate responses to crisis.","This is about preparing your people to be the calmest cucumbers in the Incident Response process. This is also about the design and deployment of measurable and repeatable exercise events. This is mostly about how ongoing preperation, training and checking your readiness in a measurable way is part of a mature security practice."
