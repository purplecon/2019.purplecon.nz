        purplecon is a forum for defenders to share their experiences and powerful infosec knowledge, so we can all
        build better and safer stuff.
      </p>
      <p>

        We’re looking for presentations about actionable information security to help people make better things, whether
        that be from the perspective of the developers writing secure code, the blue team helping them ship it, the red
        team helping them defend it, or anyone else, really.

      <h2>We’re looking for talks that are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive</strong>: we want to build an environment where people feel good and safe to talk about the
          things we can do to improve security. we’re always hearing about how -everything-is-on-fire-, let’s talk about
          how to put it out ^_^
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>actionable</strong>: so every person in the room can take away your lessons and make things a little
          bit better</li>
        <li>
          <strong>educational</strong>: the point of conference talks is to learn things. we want talks that teach the
          audience about security. we ask speakers to include links to useful or prerequisite reading if their talk
          assumes prior knowledge.
        <li>
          <strong>Documented</strong>: so that three months after the talk, people can share your work with their
          colleagues
          and actually implement Good changes. To that end, we're asking that you submit documentation alongside your
          talk that anyone can follow to make these improvements (hey it's like an actual call for papers!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>please note: talk titles containing the text "for fun and profit" will be difficult to distinguish from every
      other talk with that same joke in it. we recommend using a more descriptive title.
  </p>



      <h3>For example:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>How we made this security tool/app/bot/toaster-oven that makes our lives better (and could make yours
            better too!)</li>
          <li>How we manage our infrastructure to keep out customers safe and our developers sane</li>
          <li>creative and interesting ways of giving security advice to non-security-people.</li>
          <li>here is a cool technique, and some tips and tricks that we recently learned for testing, detection,
            protection, communication, etc.</li>
          <li>What is &lt;a thing&gt; and why is it Good?</li>
          <li>How we interact within our organisation to make sure that we ship good, safe, products (seriously, we’re
            really hoping
            for a flow or two)</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>The Great Archive</h2>
      <p>
        After the conference, we will publish a collection of resources alongside your talk, written by you. This is so
        people can Actually Use your ideas days, months, or even years after the con, without having to guess which
        YouTube video to watch.
        We would like to see:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your slides
          </li>
          <li>
            Some kind of documentation to support your talk
          </li>
        </ul>
        If you’d like us to link out to your own site/blog/minecraft server, we can definitely do that too.
