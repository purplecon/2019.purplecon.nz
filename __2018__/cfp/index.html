        purplecon is a forum for defenders to share their experiences in the wonderful world of infosec, in the hope that by doing so we can all build better and safer stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
        We’re looking for presentations about actionable information security to help people make better things, whether that be from the perspective of the developers writing secure code, the blue team helping them ship it, the red team helping them defend it, or anyone else really.

      <h2>We’re looking for talks that are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive</strong>, while we love a good hacking / the world is on fire / everything is terrible talk, that genre
          is well covered by a security themed variety show the very next day we would highly recommend</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Actionable</strong>, so every person in the room can take away your lessons and make things a little bit better</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Well documented</strong>, so that three months after the talk people can share your work with their colleagues
          and actually implement Good changes. To that end, we're asking that you submit documentation alongside your talk that anyone can follow to make these improvements (hey it's like an actual call for papers!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For example:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How we built this security thing that makes our lives better (and could make yours better too!)</li>
        <li>How we manage our infrastructure to keep out customers safe and our developers sane (now with extra checklists and
          tooling!)</li>
        <li>How we interact within the organisation to make sure that we ship good, safe, products (seriously, we’re really hoping
          for some flow charts)</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>The Great Archive</h2>
      <p>
      Following the conference we will be publishing a collection of resources including your slides and accompanying documentation on the public blagosphere. This is so people can Actually Use your ideas days, months, or even years after the con.
      We would like to see:
      <ul>
          <li>
          Your slides
          </li>
          <li>
          Some kind of documentation to support your talk
          </li>
      </ul>
        If you’d like us to link out to your own site/blog/bbs/myspace, we can definitely do that too.
      </p>

      <h2>What we imagine might be FAQs</h2>
