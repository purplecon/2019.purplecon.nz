        <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
        <p>
          We would like purplecon to be a friendly event where people from every walk of life feel welcome, so weâ€™ve written out
          our expectations for behaviour from attendees, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and anyone else involved with or
          adjacent to purplecon, including spaces where people are watching the live stream and hanging out during or after the
          con.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone. As such, we do not tolerate harassment
          in any form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age,
          race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption
          of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere related to or adjacent to purplecon, in person or other
          materials such as slides, handouts, or anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          ejecting you from the rest of the conference, preemptively banning you from future events or contacting the appropriate
          authorities. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
          contact us immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take all reports seriously, and will use discretion when responding to a report. We will be logging all reports that
          are made.
        </p>
        <p>
