        kia ora friends,

        <p>
          our knapsacks are packed, the portable tea-set fits perfectly, and we are excited to be canoeing across the
          digital realm on this adventure with y‚Äôall again!

        </p>
        <p>
          last year we ran purplecon as an experiment. we clutched our star necklaces, and looked to the sky to see what
          would happen when we ran a conference with a different attitude. we learned a lot from last year, so this year
          we‚Äôre running another experiment.

        </p>
        <p>
          we are splitting our ticket pool is split in half, so half of our tickets are reserved for people who
          self-identify as being from a marginalised<a href="#marginalised">*</a> group in tech (waiporoporo/purple
          tickets) - and half for people who don‚Äôt (mƒÅwhero/pink tickets). note that these tickets will look identical 
          on the day, and there is no way for other conference attendees to know which ticket type you‚Äôve chosen.

        </p>
        <p>
          we think it‚Äôs important that everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute to the community.
          we‚Äôre trying this because it‚Äôs a small step we can take towards creating opportunities for people with diverse
          backgrounds and improving representation both at our conference and in the wider infosec space.
          we are not asking for proof or personal details, we trust you to get the ticket that best represents you.

        </p>
        <p>
          we know that having limited tickets means some people will miss out on attending purplecon. this year we‚Äôll
          have a bunch more tickets (!1!!) and we will be live streaming and recording the whole event. we want anyone,
          anywhere, to be able to astrally project themselves with great intensity into purplecon at their convenience.
        </p>

        <p>
          we‚Äôre committed to running a good, safe, and wholesome event. here's a reminder to read through out our <a
            href="/conduct">code of conduct</a> (and see how to report incidents).
        </p>

        <p>
          tickets will be available in three waves, with a waitlist in case of cancellations. a link to get tickets will appear on this page before then, and also on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/purpleconnz">@purpleconnz</a>

      <h4 id="marginalised">*what does ‚Äúmarginalised‚Äù mean?</h4>
      <p>
        <em>"To marginalise is to treat (a person, group, or concept) as insignificant or peripheral"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of the infosec industry the people who tend to experience marginalisation are (but not limited
        to) women, non-binary, trans, maori and pasifika, people of colour, people of different ages, people who are
        differently abled. this is also sometimes referred to as ‚Äúsocial exclusion‚Äù, and it often means people from
        these groups have less access to rights, resources, and opportunities.
      </p>

      <h4>why is it good to have people from marginalised groups?</h4>
      <p>
        by working together but being different to eachother, you‚Äôre stronger. in diversity, there is strength. in
        experiments, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=do+diverse+teams+perform+better">diverse teams perform
          better</a>.
      </p>
      <p> and, well....  who would win?
        <ul>
          <li>The Avengers</li>
          <li>The Avengers, but everyone is Captain America</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>bonus ticket buying tips!</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>we recommend setting an alarm for the ticket waves so you don‚Äôt miss out</li>
        <li>don‚Äôt wait for the bureaucratic machine at your workplace to approve ticket purchases, you will likely miss
          out</li>
        <li>we recommend buying only one or two tickets at a time</li>
      </ul>
