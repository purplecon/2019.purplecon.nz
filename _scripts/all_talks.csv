You can have the speaker notes from my slides though:

* Title slide
* My story
  Want to start by telling you a story
    Back in university...
    Friend ran an online learning site, where I had an account
    Described general shape of password
    Friend took as a challenge. Site stored passwords hashed
    Cracked password
    How to tell if valid?
* Oops
  Try it on my Facebook account
    Worked!
    But I had login notifications
    Very awkward conversation
    Very impactful, know the feeling, don't want to have it happen to other people
* Account takeover
  Situation typically called an ""Account takeover"", where an account is used by someone other than its legitimate owner
    Story is a realistic example of how most accounts are compromised today
    Less important site hacked => passwords leaked => used on more sensitive service
    See a lot of attempts at this at my job: work as on the User Security team at Stripe.  Goal: protect users accounts from malicious actors
  Look online for how to prevent this from happening to you, two pieces of advice
    Use a unique password on every site
* <Logos>
  Not realistic advice
    Wildly varying estimates from different Password Manager analyses, average user has 90 (Dashlane) - 190 (LastPass) online accounts
    Just some of the sites I've used in the past that have had compromises of their password databases
    Can use a password manager, but there is an associated cost: password managers aren't necessarily user friendly for non-technical users, and they have a cost
* Two factor authentication?
  Set up 2FA
  Let's talk about 2FA
    We're going to talk about this in two parts
    Explain the different types of 2FA and their trade-offs around usability and security
    Then talk about how the think about which type of 2FA is right for you
  But what actually *is* 2FA?
  You've probably seen it before on your bank, if not on other sites
* <Two step screenshot>
  If you log in from a new device, after entering your password, prompted for a second credential
  Can come in a number of forms
  SMS to your phone, push notification, number generated by an app, number generated by a physical key...
  Notably, these methods need to be independent of one another
  Sending a code to your email != 2FA
* Table of 2FA methods
  Even ignoring email though, there are at least 4 completely different types of 2FA currently in use
  Which is a lot!
  Confusingly, each of them have different guarantees, meaning there are different reasons you might choose to adopt each one, and that in order to have a meaningful conversation, we need to explain each of them
  So let's travel back in time, and step through each of these 2FA methods one at a time, so we understand how we got here
* Early 2000s
  Specifically, we're going to travel back in time to the early 2000s
  Denim was all the rage, everyone had a Nokia 6610, and if you worked at a bank, you had an RSA SecurID
  This token was the first broadly available 2FA device to really capture the market. Launched in 1986, by 2003 70% of 2FA devices
  But it was really only available to bank employees, until the mid-2000s
* Data breaches per year chart
  Because of this graph
  Number of data breaches, for the last ~15 years
  Back in the early 2000s, data breaches just weren't a big problem
  Can't *find* a graph that goes back earlier than 2005, because that's when the Identity Theft Resource Centre even started collecting data
  First large-scale prosecution for a data breach occurred in 2004, when an engineer at AOL sold 92 million names to a marketer
  Not a large consumer need or demand for 2FA, because there were no password dumps to run against sites, and acquiring the hardware to run proxy servers was hard
* Time-based 2FA
  This meant that the 2FA method in use could have a high barrier to entry, and be higher cost
  This is where the SecurID tokens come in
  Six digit code displayed on the screen, changes every minute or so
  Banks started off using them because passwords were often PIN based, and easy to guess or shoulder surf off other employees
* Time-based 2FA algorithm
  Work by having a shared secret stored on the key
  Every 60 seconds, this is hashed with a copy of the time, to generate a new 6 digit code
  Server also knows the secret on your key, so can generate the same code
  If you know the codes are the same, great, you're in
  Banks loved them, because it meant that even if an employee's PIN was guessable, they couldn't be compromised
  There were some downsides: users had a tendency to lose their tokens, but they worked for the company: IT team could always let them back in
* Data breaches per year per industry chart
  Nearly all of these early data breaches focused on identity theft: SSNs, addresses, medical records
  Stolen from banks, universities, or the military
  Large spike in breaches come primarily from business: email addresses and passwords being stolen
* Rockyou
  2009: RockYou breach, 32 million plaintext email and password pairs
  Suddenly, an attacker could look up a user's password, and just try it on another site
  Which was a problem! Rather than having to guess a password from scratch, could just use the existing password
  In September 2010, February 2011, Google launched support for 2FA to Google Apps, and then Gmail users
  Problem: Google wanted to incentivize users, charging is not incentivizin
  Problem: Google is a global company, but users also not worth enough for Google to give them physical tokens for free
* Time-based (software) 2FA
  Google built a software time-based 2FA option
  ""Google Authenticator"", might be familiar with, looks like this
* <Time-based screenshot>
  Time-based time-based, time-based
  Same idea as the physical token
  Codes change every 30 seconds
  Secret generated when you enable 2FA
  Secret stored on your phone
* The cloud
  Let's say you chose to use Google Authenticator, or similar
  It'd be great if when you moved to a new phone, your secrets could automatically work
  Helpfully, iCloud launched in 2011, so you can backup to the cloud
  Unfortunately, that means that if I hack your iCloud account, I can restore your phone to mine, and steal your 2FA secrets. Your iCloud account tends to share the same password as your other accounts, so not too difficult
  In practice happens a lot! August 2014 celebrity photo leaks, and 2014 Sony hack
  But back in 2010, smartphones weren't a given, especially in not in all the markets Google operated in, so they did something fairly novel
* SMS 2FA
  Added support for SMS 2FA
  Principle: rather than generating 6 digit code with an algorithm, just generate a random one and store it server side
  Meant that you could receive a text message or call for second factor
  To realize just how novel: Google announced with a 15 minute SLA for SMS delivery
  Caught on quickly at other tech companies: Facebook added support for SMS 2FA a few months later, as did Wordpress, AWS, and a number of other services
  Worked well for the average user: their password would get leaked, but the attacker wouldn't control their phone, so one of these forms of 2FA would protect them
* High value targets
  Compromising accounts is a fairly lucrative market
  Fintech companies say: much harder to detect a good account going bad, than an account that's malicious from the beginning
  Attackers began to iterate
  Take a step back, and pretend you're a high value target
  Back in 2011, maybe a journalist reporting against a regime that didn't have freedom of the press, or a whistleblower for government corruption
  These days, maybe you're less altruistic, and just own a lot of cryptocurrency
* SIM porting
  Flaw in SMS 2FA: it's not a message to your phone, it's a message to your phone number
  But people lose their phones, often. And move carriers, often. Telecommunications company wants to help people not get stuck
  If someone knows information about you that's sufficient to pretend to be you on the phone, they can port your phone number to their SIM, in an attack called SIM swapping
  Your existing SIM will stop working, but you might not notice
  For the average user, these flaws weren't a big deal back in the early 2010s
  But they were a huge problem for valuable users
  Idea: what if you could send an SMS, but to the actual phone, rather than to the SIM card, to cut the telco out of the picture
* Mobile app
  Many of these companies already had proprietary apps, so shipping support for those to be used as a second factor was fairly simple
  Send a push notification down to your app with a code, congrats you have a 2FA device that a telco can't socially engineer
  Still might have the iCloud problem, but we'll come back to that
  But there is no standard for what the interface for these apps looks like
* <Duo screenshot>
  Some, like Duo let you say ""yes, this was me"" without entering a code
  Others, like Microsoft authenticator, have you choose the matching number from the site you're trying to log into
  Others function the same way as SMS, asking you to enter a code pushed down to the app from a service, via a push notification
* <Phishing screenshot comparison>
  But even this solution suffers from a problem that has plagued the Internet for the entirety of its existence: humans are fallible
  Difficult to tell the difference between a legitimate and fake site, even if you're looking
  Left: legit, right: not
  Nothing about 2FA prevents those credentials from being phished by an attacker, in a ""man in the middle"" situation - just need to be used quickly
  Evilginx; UC San Diego: costs around $100-$500 US for this type of attack
* Security key 2FA
  Basic idea: remove the human from the loop
  Wanted it to be the case that even if a user tried to give their credentials away, they couldn't
  From a user experience perspective, have a USB device, usually carried on a keychain
  Plug into your laptop and tap the gold button when you want to authorize
* Security key algorithm
  Works like this: algorithm to generate the 2FA code takes in a nonce (random value from the server), sends it to the key, along with the name of the site that is requesting authentication
  Key hashes the nonce, domain name, and its secret, to return a signed response
  But importantly, the browser *checks* that the domain name matches: if you try to sign a response for a domain name that's different, the request never makes it to the key
  Meant that even users who were successfully tricked into giving away their password, and tapping their security key, for an attacker, would give away credentials that weren't valid on the actual site
* 2FA methods
  So those are the current types of 2FA on the market
  But you might notice something interesting: we've come full circle when it comes to cost
  A decade ago we tried not to need specialized hardware for 2FA. These days, we've made it less phishable, and we've have made it cheaper, only US$20, but still not feasible for the large majority of users
  Only two authorized Yubikey resellers in Australia at all (not the only provider, but most major)
  Even if you can get your hands on a security key, have the same problems that RSA SecurIDs had (and have): what happens if you lose the token?
  If you lose your phone, you *can* call someone locally to get back into your account. That's a problem, but also a solution
* Usability
  Not talked about often enough: usability issues with 2FA
  For the actual user, not an attacker
  We consider DOS'ing a service to be a form of security issue, why not a user being locked out of their account due to our actions
  Really gets to the human part of 2FA: it's not worth securing a service that you don't use, because you hate it
  I've seen users get frustrated about this, a lot
  So let's talk about the most common reasons that people get locked out of their accounts
  Means that there is no way for them to get back in, short of talking to the service provider and out of band verifying their identity
* 2FA usability
  We've already said that there's a problem with losing a physical key
  But remember that issue with iCloud backups? Google have actually solved that, they just don't back up your secrets to the cloud
  But the next time you lose your phone, that means you lose your secrets
  Or more likely, the next time September rolls around and the new iPhones come out
  For SMS the lost or stolen case is covered, you can just call your telco
  But if you're traveling internationally and your phone isn't roaming? You're locked out
  Mobile apps have the same problem as authenticator app: either you let them be backed up to the cloud, and hope that account isn't compromised, or you get locked out if you lose your phone
  And security keys have two problems: you can lose them, and they can't be used on a phone
  Clearly there are some real trade-offs to be made here
  Can lower your risk of being locked out by adding more forms of 2FA
  But that also increases the number of ways that someone can get into your account, since only security keys are human-proof
  Want to make the right decisions here, for ourselves, our family, and our users, need a framework with which to evaluate the options
* Threat modeling
  It's hard to think about abstract risk, so lets make it a bit more familiar
  A friend pays you back at work, and you need to walk to the bank to deposit the money. Would you feel safe?
  Probably yes!
* Threat modeling (take 2)
  But I have a friend who really likes to skydive. Buys parachutes on Craigslist, gets paid in cash, and often needs to walk that literal bag of cash to the bank
  Does that change the safety of the situation to you?
  What if you literally had a sack with a dollar sign written on it, so it was obvious you were carrying a lot of money?
  What about if it were at night?
  Or during the day, but the bank is in a high crime area of town known for muggings?
  What if you were carrying $1000, or $10,000 in cash?
  Maybe you'd consider asking a friend to come with you?
  Could drive there instead?
  If really worried, could hire a bodyguard
  This process of thinking about the possible risks, and figuring out ways to mitigate them is something we do every day of our lives. Has a fancy name in security: threat modeling
* Are you a target?
  That's what we should be doing when figuring out which forms of 2FA to use ourselves
  Think about whether the area of the Internet you're operating in makes you a target. If your account contains money, this is absolutely you
  If your account isn't super valuable, can probably use a less secure type of 2FA
* Users, friends, and family
  Knowing about threat modeling is useful when it comes to our own personal choices, but the problem is more complex when we think about users, or family
  If you have less exposure to security issues, and less understanding of the concepts, you will think about the trade-offs differently here
  It's the difference between someone who knows that the bank area is known for muggings, and not
* Harm reduction
  The advice we give people needs to take into account whether or not the request is reasonable
  Maybe you think it would be safest to hire a bodyguard to head with you to the bank - the equivalent of using a security key
  If your friend asks you for advice, and there's no chance they'd pay for a bodyguard, you should offer them an alternative, e.g. take a friend
  This is the concept of harm reduction: try to reduce the amount of damage that's done, even if your new solution isn't perfect
  SMS 2FA is the ""take a friend with you"" option of the 2FA world
  It's not perfect, but it does substantially reduce the harm
  Unless you think you can reasonably convince your family members or users to use another form of 2FA, it's probably what you should be recommending
* Key takeaways
  If you run a cryptocurrency site, you should be recommending that your users use security keys or a time-based 2FA method
  If you run a site with fairly little PII, where it wouldn't matter if a user's account was compromised, can consider not recommending 2FA, or only recommending SMS
  Keep in mind the harm reduction principle: some 2FA is better than no 2FA, from a security perspective
* My story
  Back to that story I told at the beginning
  Friend apologized, but I was still angry at him for a while. We stayed friends!
  Both went on to work in the security industry
  He still prefers breaking things, but I went on to try and learn how to fix them
  Most importantly: after my Facebook account got hacked, I started using a password manager, and turned on 2FA
  Hopefully get to help other people not go through the same experience

8/12/2019 8:22:44,fobski@gmail.com,3,5,4,5,17,Yes,,Embracing Empathy ,"Empathy is a personality trait which is not often discussed in the world of InfoSec. In an industry with highly authoritative technical personalities, curious technical explorers and fully transparent decision makers empathy is the odd one out, why care about what other people think or feel when you have the mandate to enforce policy/solutions/architecture/technology as you have funding and ""because security"".

In this talk I will take you through how in my now near 20-year career predominately in the enterprise space I have tried to be anything BUT empathetic, the feeling of impostor syndrome I carried around for years as the way I worked and achieved results was not covered by any conference talks/certs/training/industry groups. And how through necessity I went from realizing that while my approach to InfoSec had always been classed as ""pragmatic"" it was empathetic. And that Empathy worked wonders in the most trying time of my career.",Shahn Harris,Shahn is a corporate infosec jerk who has been the cause and solution to a number of security related incidents since the the early 2000's.,https://twitter.com/fobski,"This is a new talk and has not been done anywhere.

After listening to far much Kid Cudi and obscure Youtube rappers I have decided to bare my soul in this talk as for years despite being I guess somewhat known NZ InfoSec for a variety of reasons I felt I didn't fit in.

I have had severe impostor syndrome since 2009 as I am not deep tech, I am not a hacker, I am not Transformation expert, I am not an auditor and I am not compliance expert. Sure I can do all of the above to a certain extent but that is not my passion, my passion is creating cultural change inside an organisation by building relationships, connections and drawing the dots between business initiatives, technology, security. To do that you need empathy to understand everyone's position and give advice that is actionable and not ""because security"" while at the same time ensuring the security team you are part of agrees with the advice you are dealing which can cause a large emotional drain on one’s self. 

But the statement regarding what is my passion is something I have recently embraced and recognized, Prior to that if you had asked me what my passion is, it would be a vague answer as I could not articulate it or point to any touchstone talk or methodology/cert that explained it. The reason I can now articulate it is in 2016 I joined the Equifax security team, in 2017 the breach occurred, and I was left alone in NZ to get stuff done so I dropped the charade, embraced my empathetic side and got shit done. Empathy works, and I want to share this fact with the purple audience as I believe it is something that needs to be shared. 

So the talk will cover what shaped me in my career, my impostor syndrome, my empathy realization and how it works in a chaotic environment.

They do this by reviewing old events, reviewing their playbook against them and rehearsing under time pressure with unkown inputs. 

I’ll go over different ways of gaining and understanding experiences and how they can be applied to new circumstances. I’ll then talk give examples of exercises or experiences that people would have participated in during their life and show how they have prepared them how to handle high pressure or novel events gracefuly. There will also be a brief discussion of how these events can be used with non-techncial groups to educate them on security concerns in a non-confrontational manner. 

I’ll discuss some principles of exercise design and a few gotchas that can cause a well intentioned event to fall flat.Finally I will provide a bibliography of resources to get started in event design and evaluation.

To the greate archive I shall submit: Slides, a 2 page cheatsheet for developing and running exercises and a bibliography for those who want to learn the craft..",20 mins,suggestions for cute breakfast places near the venue,"Earl Grey Shortbread

Whether it's securing access to resources, synchronising data between devices, or providing a customised experience, any new project will soon need that login form.

I'm hoping to help solve those problems by showing how a basic risk assessment (that asks the same top four questions your security person probably does) can help by letting low risk projects move quickly without needing to go through a million approvals, and directing you to the relevant people to consult and key things to consider for higher risk projects. It also lets teams self serve so security and risk teams can focus on the higher risk items. I'd then like to include some options for making it more comprehensive if the organisation is ready for that, like linking it in to your CMDB.

I'm planning to include a bunch of example flow charts that people could follow for their own risk assessments or edit to change the questions and recommendations. I'm planning to release variations for developing new features, procuring a new vendor or determining maximum outage periods for business continuity.

Using science and statistics to make decisions about how you run security is a great idea - /if/ you can interpret and represent your data accurately. But statistics is rife with potential pitfalls that can lead you to all kinds of false conclusions.

He dabbles in Product Security at Atlassian, and enjoys playing the other kind of keyboard.",https://twitter.com/noqry,"Outline:

- You don’t have to know any fancy maths to understand stats principles; these are logical principles, not mathematical ones.
- Even if you don’t plan on analyzing any data yourself, understanding these principles lets you notice if other analyses get it wrong.
- The difference between observational and interventional studies, and why it’s important (i.e., observational studies only complete 2/5 steps of the scientific method).
- As defenders, virtually all the data we gather about our systems is observational, because interventions are expensive. Observational studies have certain pitfalls, which we’ll talk about.
- Observational studies are rife with confounding variables, which lead to false conclusions from “correlation equals causation”. Here’s how to identify confounding variables using a Bayesian network.
- If you did identify confounding variables, here are tips about how to slice the data to cut them out.
- Be sure to account for proportionality. A huge organization may have 50,000 bugs, while a smaller company only has 50 bugs. But if the big organization is more than 1,000 times larger than the small one, it’s still doing a better job when you account for the relative size.
- Check the sample population; a skewed population will mess up your results. Your conclusions won’t reflect the variables you’re trying to look at, but the underlying skew of the sample.
- Check the sample size. Drawing conclusions from a few examples is silly because the effects might have been caused by chance (or in stats language, the “p-value” is too high).
- Once you get your results, beware of rationalizing them - i.e., trying to explain them when you don’t really know what causes them. Here’s a simple test to catch if you’re rationalizing.

The Great Archive material will include more statistics tips that don’t fit into the talk time. I’ll also change the talk title if I can find a better one that’s less uncouth.

Their new operating system, the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), was the first multi-user OS and they wanted a way for each user to have their own private files. They did this using passwords. In 1962 a Ph.D. student in need of additional computer time found a solution to his problem; he submitted an off-line job to print the entire password file and simply started using other people’s accounts.

For decades the security profession has been recommending security controls and practices that are impractical, unjustified, and often ineffective. We have inadvertently forced people to work around the very controls that we hoped would protect them just so they can do their jobs. We have based our advice on “best practice” mythology absent of evidence, and we have driven a cultural wedge between our profession and the people and organisations we're trying to help.

,,3,3,4,4,14,No,,What are we worried about?,"What are we worried about? This is a talk about helping teams learn to build realistic threat models. 

Security has been great at talking to other security people about how important it is to have a well considered threat model. However when we bring the rest of the business along with us and excitedly say to them "" Lets be baddies"" teams struggle.

I will be taking you through some of the quite remarkable perceived threats engineers and executives alike put forward during threat modelling sessions I have recently run and the reactions I got when I had to course correct.

It turns out that when security is not 100% your daily grind the frame of reference you have for threat modelling will have come from all sorts of places like Mr Robot or media coverage of huge cyber attacks. 
​ 
So how can we as security people be better educators? How do we help our teammates get the context to build more realistic threat models?

I start with where to look for data on the breaches and incidents that typically happen in your industry and some places you can look internally in your own business to get even more information.

I'll also be talking through the process I have come up with to better define the kinds of threat actors you want to consider when building your threat model and how to write malicious user stories as a team. 

A threat model based on industry evidence with realistic well considered threat actors is going to help teams pick better mitigation's and controls giving you confidence your limited defensive resources are being well used. So, what are we worried about?",,kiwicon suggestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I want to do is take the attendees through a journey of parallel universes where they a responsible for a website and the users table gets leaked. In the plaintext universe, what happens? Then the next universe we've hashed it - and what is a hash?! - does that fix it? (No, identical passwords == identical hashes).  We need something called a salt - what’s that? Where does it live? Does that fix it? Yes, but - we can do mathsy stuff over and over again to make things slow. But isn’t slow bad for websites?! Not in this case. So now what, are we done? Pretty much, but then there are different algorithms - which one is best? (MD5 bad blah blah, Argon/scrypt/bcrypt good etc).

I acknowledge that people probably _could_ google this, but ... no one does :( So giving a talk is one way to increase awareness! Then attendees can go off and dig deeper on things they resonate with.

The five topics are a mix of dev vs. test vs. manager focus, so there should be something for everyone! They get progressively higher-level / higher maturity, to reflect at what stage you might want to adopt them in your own org.

It'll probably be something like:

  - OWASP Top 10 - this is the one you've probably heard of, an example of one of the top 10 and how they write it up. Good for testers validating holes.
  - OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls - this is one everyone should actually read, it's really good for devs & BAs trying to do things right the first time
  - OWASP Juice Shop - an intentionally vulnerable app, solve challenges of varying difficulty, with hints and solutions in a handy book

I want to share this strategy on how, when we have review, we can make that part of a journey towards making an entire company more secure, rather than just an isolated test.

I'd like to cover a number of items that, while they are obvious to an IT Security Consultant, can help someone with less security experience better understand the need for review and when to ask for help.

I intend to answer the following questions:
""Should you get security review? If so, when and why"" 
""What does a security consultant know that a security conscious developer doesn't?""

My current list of items for getting the most value out of an engagement are:
1. Do your own internal check first, and tick off any ""low-hanging"" fruit.
2. Have developers investigate and fix issues ahead of time, it's better to review a fix, and find an issue, then to implement a flawed fix and not know.
3. Engage with review early on in the development or procurement process
4. Have completely independent infrastructure setup 
5. Be prepared to wipe and re-build environments during testing
6. Assign an experienced developer to work with a consultant, if they can fix issues and have the fixes tested while review is underway, great! 
7. When you recieve a report, share it around the development teams, what issues you found, how you fixed them, and what surprised you. If you work consistently with a specific stack you should be able to handle these issues ahead of time in the future

So how can you keep hold of it? By using jokes! (Or a grappling hook, if you have one. But I prefer the jokes.)

Learn about different flavours of jokes, how to select and write the right ones for your security communications, and how to be a kind and thoughtful jokester. No gags experience required.",Anton Black,"Anton aspires to speak clearly, concisely, humorously and precisely about something or other. He dabbles in Product Security at Atlassian, and enjoys playing the other kind of keyboard.",https://twitter.com/noqry,"Outline:

- This is a talk about jokes. Since talks are about explaining things, and we all know what happens when you explain a joke, please prepare yourself for a vast swathe of joke murder. Don’t report me to the NZP, I’m willing to bribe you with free bubble tea.
- When giving a security talk, it doesn’t matter how insightful your technical content; is if you’ve lost the audience’s attention, it’s game over. This is even more important if you’re communicating technical content to a non-technical audience.
- Good speakers maintain the audience’s attention in different ways. One great way to keep the audience’s attention is to put jokes in your talk.
- You’ve probably heard this advice before but didn’t find it useful. Maybe you’ve never put jokes in your talks before. You may have an image of yourself as someone who just isn’t funny; you’re “too serious”, you “take things too literally”. Or you might feel that there just isn’t any angle to make jokes on in your talk. In other words, you’re not naturally funny.
- But people who are “naturally funny” had to work on it too; they just started earlier. If you ask the funny people in your life when they got into the jokes manufacturing business, you’ll usually find they started years ago and slowly honed their craft, testing and refining their material over the years.
- Furthermore, it’s not necessary to be an overflowing font of spontaneous gags if you’re giving a security talk, because you can prepare in advance. Being a spontaneous comedian: Very Hard. Writing jokes for a prepared talk: Much Easier.
- In fact, there’s a formula you can use to put jokes in your security talk. It has two steps:
    (1) Understand that jokes come in different types; and
    (2) For any given situation, scan through the different types of jokes and see which of them can be applied.

- So, what types of jokes are there? (Start discussing each category of jokes, with the examples. This takes up the middle section of the talk.)

- Now when you go to write your talk, you can have the list of joke categories at the ready. Suppose you’re talking about <Example topic>; we can see that you could apply <Relevant Joke A>, <Relevant Joke B>, and <Relevant Joke C>. That’s how it works in action.
- The more you use jokes, the more you’ll see that you have a natural taste for some types of jokes - jokes categories you like or dislike. For example, references to recent security news (like “lol, Equifax”) strike me pretty coldly, while I think the over-the-top-politeness joke is hilarious (e.g. purplecon’s “h*ck”). Everyone’s different; choose a style that suits you.
- Finally, understand your ethical responsibilities as a jokester. Don’t use humour to be unkind; observe the principle of “don’t punch down”, especially when you’re pointing out security flaws in a system.

- Introduction of who I am, etc.
- Overview of the session
- Brief history of phone hacking pre-VoIP e.g. phone phreaking
- Quick recap of the basic tech principles of VoIP systems
- Overview of the common attack vectors for VoIP

For the next sections, I will detail how these attacks work and can be applied in detail with real life examples - either from my own experience or more well-known ones:

- Network level attacks - VLAN hopping, eavesdropping on VoIP traffic, DDoS, etc.
- Abusing DTMF tones
- Toll fraud
- Contact centre scripts and functions
- Voicemail attacks (we'll also cover the famous "" celebrity voicemail hacking"" incident from the UK
- SS7 hacks (I know this isn't strictly VoIP but as most VoIP things break out into the traditional PSTN at some point I think it's worth mentioning, also there's some crazy stuff people have alleged the NSA have done in this area)

- Summary and close

The purpose of this talk is to give an insight into a less well known area of security and hacking. I find that most people's knowledge focuses more on traditional network infrastructure, cloud and application attacks (which makes sense as there is far more work in that area) but VoIP and telephony is - in my opinion - infinitely interesting and gives attendees an increased knowledge in this area.",,kiwicon suggestion,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,

,,1,3,2,2,8,No,,Gargoyle hunting: Detecting 'Gargoyle' code-hiding via automated Windows kernel analysis,"Every so often, a mechanism becomes popular which is difficult to detect. Gargoyle is a good example of this - it relies on Windows timer events to achieve execution from (almost) non-executable memory. While it would be nice to detect it by examining active timers, Windows exposes very little information about timers to user-space, making it impossible.

In this talk, I will demonstrate how a kernel debugger can be used to examine Windows internal data structures and how to extract the information we need. I will use demonstrate how to enumerate system timers, and to find the code that each timer will trigger. Once this code is located, a Volatility plugin will be written to replicate the work, and I will demonstrate how to assess how suspicious the triggered code is by using an emulation framework to detect operations intrinsic to the attack itself, such as a stack pivot or adjusting memory page permissions via VirtualProtect.

Complete code for the plugin is public. After the talk, attendees should be confident in modifying it to detect other kernel-level artifacts, and to create their own Volatiltiy plugins to find other suspicious activity as required.

,,1,1,1,1,4,No,duplicate talk submission,Defensive Social Engineering - Ethical Human Hacking,"Have you ever wondered why someone, even smart people, would fall for a scam? From Nigerian Princes, to handsome retired navy generals looking for a romantic relationship, to green card lottery wins. Hope is fundamental to human nature and as long as there is hope, there will be scams. And with the advancement of technology, scams are not only more common, but harder to trace. What then, is the best thing security professionals can do to stop people from getting hooked?

This talk wants to focus on the “social” in social engineering and encourage security teams to engage with their colleagues in the wider corporation. The term ""social engineering"" has a bad rap. It often means deceiving people to get information out of them but the common solution seems to be teaching people to distrust others by following policies that stops them from caring for another human being. Instead of teaching people to be “anti-social engineers”, we should be teaching them to be “pro-social engineers”. In an organisational context, this means building trust, cultural change and creating herd immunity against social engineering attacks.
